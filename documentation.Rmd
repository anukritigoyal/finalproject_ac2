### Purpose

The purpose of our project was to depict the relationship between the existence of chronic diseases and the different states that they exist in, as well as the different groups of people the diseases affect annually. We chose to focus on Diabetes, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Cardiovascular Disease as they had the most annual indicators of mortality in the United States. We were interested in seeing the change in the mortality as developments in healthcare advanced over the years and health officials' continuous actions lead to potential improvements in healthcare services.

So far,there has been nothing but an increase in the mortality rates for these diseases. Even if the mortality rate does decrease, it does not necessarily mean that less patients are getting diagnosed with the disease. It is likely that as the population of the country increases, the number of cases and mortalities will only increase with time. All three of the diseases incur hefty costs but they can be avoided by adapting a healthy lifestyle.

### Data Source

The data set that we worked with can be found [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators-cdi-e50c9).

The information was found in the Health section of Data.gov, however, it was initially published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
